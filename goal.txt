many are there in ghana but
only few were seen at the beach.
ghanaians are not ready for a change
since they only care about themselves
and what they will get today
the youth are been cloned to behave and think 
like the modern day politicians.
they start their kind of politics
right from the universities.
such youth are going to be the once coming to takeover 
from their pay masters.
